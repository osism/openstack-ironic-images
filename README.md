## Burnin

The image is used to read out some information about a system and perform
rudimentary memory and CPU tests. The results are saved under /opt.

Once all tests have been completed, the system is shut down.

```
$ sudo dd if=osism-burnin-image.raw of=/dev/sdb bs=8M status=progress
```

```
$ sudo parted /dev/sdb print
Warning: Not all of the space available to /dev/sdb appears to be used, you can fix the GPT to use all
of the space (an extra 112797696 blocks) or continue with the current setting?
